# DDD & Event sourcing workshop

### What we will try to implement
* an event-sourced aggregate: Person
* some value objects for a Person: Name, EmailAddress, Address
* some domain events: PersonRegistered, PersonEmailAddressConfirmed, PersonAddressAdded, PersonAddressChanged
* the methods in the Person aggregate which will cause the above events
* we'll try to work test-driven as much as possible

### Let's apply 
 * DDD principles and 
 * make the model Event sourced

### My choice of programming language
 * Golang
